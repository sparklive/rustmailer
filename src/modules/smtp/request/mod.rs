/// A structure representing the envelope of an email used for sending.
///
/// The `MailEnvelope` struct encapsulates the sender and recipient information required
/// for email transmission, specifically for defining the SMTP envelope. The SMTP envelope
/// is used by mail servers to route emails and is distinct from the email headers seen by
/// end users. This struct is necessary to specify the "MAIL FROM" and "RCPT TO" fields
/// in the SMTP protocol, which determine the actual sender and recipients of the email,
/// regardless of the "From" or "To" headers in the email content. It is typically used
/// in email clients or servers to prepare emails for delivery via an SMTP server.
///
/// # Purpose
/// - **Routing**: The envelope defines the actual sender and recipient addresses used by
///   SMTP servers for routing the email.
/// - **Delivery**: Ensures emails are sent to the correct recipients, even if the email
///   headers (e.g., "To" or "CC") differ.
/// - **Validation**: Allows email systems to validate sender and recipient addresses
///   before transmission.
/// - **Flexibility**: Supports multiple recipients for sending emails to several
///   addresses in a single transaction.
///
/// # Usage
/// This struct is used when interacting with an SMTP client library to send emails. For
/// example, it can be passed to an SMTP client to set up the sender and recipient details
/// before sending the email content.

/// the delivery status of an email sent using a `MailEnvelope`. This is particularly useful for
/// tracking delivery outcomes or debugging email sending issues, especially when combined with
/// retry mechanisms (e.g., `Retry` struct).
///
/// ### Purpose
/// - **Status Tracking**: Allows the sender to receive notifications about the success, failure,
///   or delay of email delivery.
/// - **Debugging**: Helps diagnose issues in email delivery by providing detailed status information.
/// - **Customization**: Enables fine-grained control over DSN behavior, including what content to
///   return and which recipients to track.
/// - **Reliability**: Works with retry mechanisms to ensure robust email delivery workflows.
///
/// ### Usage
/// This struct is typically used with an SMTP client to configure DSN settings for an email defined
/// by a `MailEnvelope`. For example, it can specify that DSNs should be sent for delivery failures
/// and include full email content in the notification.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```
/// use NotifyOption::*;
/// let dsn_config = DSNConfig {
///     ret: ReturnContent::Full, // Assuming ReturnContent::Full is defined
///     envid: Some("unique-id-123".to_string()),

/// - **Exponential**: Retries are scheduled with an exponentially increasing delay between
///   attempts, useful for reducing server load during repeated failures.
///

/// retry attempts for sending an email. It is used in conjunction with an SMTP client and
/// the `MailEnvelope` struct to handle transient failures during email transmission, such
/// as network issues or temporary server errors.
///
/// ### Purpose
/// - **Reliability**: Ensures emails are retried in case of temporary failures, improving
///   delivery success rates.
/// - **Flexibility**: Allows customization of retry behavior (linear or exponential) to
///   balance between prompt retries and server load management.
/// - **Control**: Limits the number of retries to prevent infinite loops in case of
///   persistent failures.
///
/// ### Usage
/// This struct is typically used to configure an SMTP client to retry sending an email
/// (defined by a `MailEnvelope`) when a failure occurs. For example, it can specify that
/// retries should occur with a linear delay of 5 seconds up to 3 times.
///
