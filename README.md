## 🎯 Use Cases

RustMailer is designed to be seamlessly integrated into your applications, helping you save development time and improve efficiency by providing a robust, self-hosted email synchronization and delivery backend supporting **IMAP/SMTP, and Gmail API**.

Typical use cases and industries include:

- SaaS platforms requiring multi-account email synchronization (IMAP or Gmail)
- CRM systems with automated transactional email sending  
- Marketing automation tools supporting dynamic email templates  
- Customer support software integrating real-time email notifications  
- Enterprise applications needing reliable IMAP, SMTP, or Gmail API handling  
- E-commerce platforms managing order confirmation and promotional emails  
- Data analytics solutions tracking email opens and clicks via webhooks  
- Fintech and healthcare systems demanding secure and auditable email workflows  
 

RustMailer enables developers to focus on core application logic without building complex mail infrastructure from scratch.

## 💡 Why RustMailer?

While many programming languages provide IMAP, SMTP, or Gmail API client libraries, building a reliable, scalable, and feature-rich mail synchronization and delivery system from scratch remains complex and time-consuming. 
RustMailer abstracts these challenges by offering a unified, self-hosted middleware service that:

- Handles multi-account IMAP polling and caching efficiently  
- Provides robust SMTP sending capabilities with template support  
- Manages event dispatch (webhooks, message queues) out of the box  
- Simplifies integration across diverse application stacks regardless of language  

This allows development teams to focus on core business logic, accelerating time-to-market and reducing maintenance overhead compared to assembling disparate mail client libraries individually.

## 🧠 Webhooks & NATS

RustMailer supports periodic detection of mail changes (e.g. new messages, flag updates, etc.) using scheduled scans.  
It does **not rely on real-time push**, but instead performs full or incremental synchronization at configurable intervals.

Mail events are then emitted as:

RustMailer detects mail changes (e.g. new messages, flag updates, etc.) by periodically scanning IMAP folders.  
It performs either **full** or **incremental synchronization**, depending on configuration. see details [`https://rustmailer.com/docs/guide/imap-sync`](https://rustmailer.com/docs/guide/imap-sync)

Detected events can be forwarded using:

- **Webhooks** – Supports payload transformation using [VRL](https://www.vrl.dev/)
- **NATS Messages** – Also supports VRL scripting for custom routing and filtering

> 🔧 Each mail account can be configured with **either** a webhook or a NATS sink — not both.  
> 🌐 In addition, RustMailer supports **one or more global hooks**, which apply to all accounts.

## 🖥️ Web Interface

RustMailer includes a lightweight web-based mail client and admin panel, primarily designed to help developers debug and inspect synced mail content.

Accessible at:

```
http://localhost:15630
```
### 🔐 Web UI Access Control

- If `RUSTMAILER_ENABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=false` (default), the Web UI is accessible without authentication.
- If `RUSTMAILER_ENABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=true`, access is restricted to requests that provide a valid **root token**.

> The root token file is generated at startup under the directory specified by `--rustmailer-root-dir`  
> or the `RUSTMAILER_ROOT_DIR` environment variable.  
> The token is stored in a file named: `root`

> ⚠️ The root access session expires after 5 days and requires re-authentication.

From 1.4.0, By default, the Web UI uses username/password authentication:
```
Default username: root
Default password: root
```
After logging in, the user can change the default password through the Web UI.
